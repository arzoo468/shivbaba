      <p>The Supreme Soul needs to communicate with all human souls. But how? All human souls have a body and the Supreme soul does not. Hence He needs to become like us in order to talk, interact, explain and communicate.He takes the support of an ordinary human being and makes him his instrument in order to do his task. He names him Prajapita Brahma and starts his task.</p>

    <p class="text-muted text-left" >The Supreme soul does not take birth and nor does he die like other souls. He only enters this Corporeal world once in a cycle to transform it. However all the souls are encased in physical outfits called bodies. In order to reach them, the Supreme soul needs to wear a physical costume as well. However since He does not come into the cycle of births and deaths, he cannot come into the womb of a mother and take birth like other souls. He enters the body of a person who is already full grown, 60 years old, experienced and has lived a life of family bliss, managed a successful business and was deeply religious.He was known as Lekhraj Kripalini. He is the same soul who was born during the Golden period as Lord Krishna. He has completed his maximum 84 births and this is his last birth in the cycle. As per this world drama this soul forgets his births and that he was the same soul who was once known as Krishna. The Supreme soul gets drawn to this soul and makes him his instrument in order to fulfill his huge duty of transforming this world into heaven once again. </p>

<p class="text-danger text-left">Gradually as Lekhraj Kripalini starts understanding how God needs his help to change the world, he changes his lavish lifestyle into simple and a spiritual one. He starts feeling distaste for the old world, and starts longing for the new world that the Supreme soul is planning to make. The Supreme soul uses his mouth to speak the knowledge known as "Gita gyan". Lekhraj Kripalini is renamed as Prajapita Brahma or Adidev and he is the first Brahman, and the ancestor of all human souls. In the scriptures he is shown as the old deity with white beard, four heads representing the knowledge shared by God was spread across all directions, and he is seen with four arms representing cooperation that he received from other mouth born Brahmans.</p>

<h5 class="text-danger text-center" >The way to connect with the Supreme soul is through meditation</h5>

<p class="text-warning text-left" >Now that we know Him, how do we connect to Him? To achieve this we need to know ourselves first as only self realisation can lead to God realisation. Just as our Father is a tiny point of energy, we too are the same. We are all energy and is known by various names like soul, atma, rooh, spirit etc. Only because we are using a physical costume called "body", we lost the realisation with time that we are souls. We enter a bodily costume, use it, then discard it after use to attain another one and get into this cycle. However our Father, the Supreme Soul does not go through this. He neither takes a body nor sheds one. In order to connect with Him the first step is to realise ourself as a soul, or a tiny point of light residing in the center of the forehead that controls the entire body. Then we can slowly focus on the Supreme soul, our Real Father, whom we affectionately call "Shiv Baba", that He too is a soul but He is the Highest of High, purest and most powerful. The word "yog" means to "unite"/"add". In the process of meditation with visualization technique we unite with the Supreme soul using our mind and intellect. As he is forever charged with infinite energy, I the soul start receiving the energy in the process of union, and thus get rejuvenated, recharged and refreshed. Just like a phone needs to recharged everyday, similarly meditation is not a one time process.
